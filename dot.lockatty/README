These two files, echo and pw, are the only files that should be located in home's .lockatty folder. The pw file
contains the md5 hash of your password. The example included is the hash of the password "Password". If you wish
to reset your password, all you have to do is delete the pw file and the program will prompt you for a new password. 

The echo file contains text that will be outputted when lockatty prompts you for a password. The example echo file
contains an ascii Slackware logo (credit to dylanaraps, from his neofetch program).
